FARMS (Farms Advanced Raster Metagraphic Standard - A graphic extension 
      of vt100)

This project is to create a raster graphics extension to the common vt100 
     terminal standard.

This new terminal will emulate the vt100 terminals while adding an optional 
     graphics ability for programmers.


Code Standards:
- All lines in the source code should be less than 80 columns.
- Naming conventions will use underscores.
- Class names should have an uppercase first letter example: Pencil.
- The language of choice will be C++ and can use the STL for C++.
- C++ style strings should be used when possible.
